[Unilever.com](http://Unilever.com) received **23.5 million** page views and **1.6 million** visits [in April](http://similarweb.com). This is one site out of their network of 80+.  
  
These numbers are one reason why it’s a _big_ deal that they’ve made a public commitment to [Digital Sustainability](https://www.unilever.com/digital-sustainability/).

## The hidden impact of a web page

Let’s, for a second, assume a _50/50_ split between new and returning visitors to their Sustainability page in April.

Serving that single page to those visitors over that month would have produced [**259kg of CO2**](https://digitalbeacon.co/report/unilever-comdigital-sustainability). That’s equivalent to watching **101 hours of Netflix** (in HD) or **driving 445 miles** in a Tesla Model S.

To offset this amount of CO2, **you’d need to plant 13 trees in a year**. This is for one single page.

## Moving from one page, to many

Now, let’s take it further and admittedly go a bit rudimentary, but stick with me.

If you go to [Unilever’s sitemap page](https://www.unilever.com/sitemap/) and do a [quick link count](https://www.webfx.com/tools/links-counter/), there are 323 links. You’d discount some of these, such as anchor links.

However, if we assume for a second that half of these are valid, that’s still **161 pages**. Now, let’s again assume 259kg of CO2 per page for the sake of argument.

We’re looking at **41,699kg of CO2 for** these **161 pages**.

On average, a single tree can absorb around [22 kilograms of CO2 annually](https://gegcalculators.com/trees-to-offset-carbon-calculator/).

To absorb the CO2 that [Unilever.com](http://Unilever.com) produces in a month, **you’d need 1,895 trees.**

I don’t know what things looked like before the changes they made, and there’s still work to be done (for example, check out the PageSpeeds Insight report for mobile).

Even without being able to look back, this highlights **the scale of possible opportunity** if sustainability is brought firmly into technology professionals’ processes, practices, and tools.

Let’s encourage, challenge, and ultimately create a better web.
