Hi, I'm Alex - a Senior Solutions Architect and Technology Consultant currently working at [Amdaris](https://amdaris.com), with a decade+ of experience across Marketing Agencies, Data Consultancies and Software Houses.

Technology is *incredible,* *exciting*, and often *life-changing*, but it shouldn't be forgotten that it's a set of toolsâ€”tools built **by us**, **for us**, to use to achieve and experience a vast number of different things.

In my work, I use holistic systems thinking principles and approaches to help people and organisations solve complex challenges in meaningful ways that improve our daily lives.

Additionally, I work to guide our use and creation of Technology towards being in line with the principles outlined in the [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/).
