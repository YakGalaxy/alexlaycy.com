## Privacy Policy

To get critical information about the behaviour of my visitors, The Site utilises [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com). This analytics software gives me insight about my visitors only in general, and not about individuals per say, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information.
