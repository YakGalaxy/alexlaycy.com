[![Build and Deploy Jekyll Site](https://github.com/YakGalaxy/alexlaycy.com/actions/workflows/deployment.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YakGalaxy/alexlaycy.com/actions/workflows/deployment.yml)

Predominantly written and edited in [Obsidian](https://stephango.com/obsidian) (a lightweight note-taking application), with plain text Obsidian files being automatically compiled into web pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static site generator).  They are then deployed using a custom GitHub Action [(Jekyll-SSH-deploy-action)](https://github.com/YakGalaxy/jekyll-SSH-deploy-action) onto shared hosting [(Krystal.io)](https://krystal.io/) which is powered by renewable energy.

Additionally, [Apache's mod_deflate module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html) is utilised to compress output from the server before it is sent, and I'm working towards the site colour scheme being fully WCAG AAA compliant.

## Ongoing Development

This site is under constant development with additions and improvements being made over time. Bugs, issues, and everything in between will be present - if you find anything [let me know!](mailto:alex@alexlaycy.com)

## Sources & Inspiration

- The overall workflow was inspired by [Obsidian Jekyll workflow](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow). 
- ["Final mother... website"](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/) helped me to look for the absolute minimum needed for the site to fulfill it's purpose.
